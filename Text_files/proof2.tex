\section{Proofs}

Lemma 1: Bounds on the expected imbalance and bias of the SBW-estimator under classical measurement error 

Lemma 2: Consistency of regression calibration for known $\kappa$. The consistency of estimated $\kappa$ follows if we have a consistent estimator of $\kappa$.

Lemma 3. H-SBW minimizes variance under $\Sigma$


Lemma 5. H-SBW with standard regression calibration does not achieve balance on true X; is biased. OLS is not

Proof sketch: First derive the result using OLS and GLS. Then by Lemma 4 we can represent SBW as OLS weights on some subset. H-SBW bias is different from GLS bias (since changes $n_j$

Also need: Can represent H-SBW as GLS weights on some subset.
